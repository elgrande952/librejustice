//! Whole-corpus counters (`corpus_counts`), decisions and legal texts alike.
//! Single writer: `precompute`. Both citation axes come from the index rather
//! than a `GROUP BY` over the arrays, 2.3 s against 6.45 s; the count of
//! articles in force takes 8.2 s on its own, which is what justifies writing a
//! snapshot instead of counting at read time. The `seat` dimension carries the
//! whole room axis, one row per unfolded path, its parent being the path minus
//! its last segment: the tree has as many levels as the corpus has, and the
//! landing page no longer advertises a third level that was always empty.
