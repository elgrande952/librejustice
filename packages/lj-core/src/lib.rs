//! `lj-core`: the decision model shared by the server and the ingest.

//! No I/O at runtime: the `Decision` model, its dates, docket keys, chambers
//! and publication, and the text primitives it rests on (recasing, cleaning,
//! titles). Static data is embedded through `include_str!`. The source parsers
//! live in `lj-parse`, the referential of the legal texts in `lj-norm`, the
//! search text analysis in `lj-textsearch`, the stamped versions in
//! `lj-versions`.
